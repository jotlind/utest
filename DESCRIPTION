Description: An implementation of Lind and Mehlum's (2010) Utest to test for the presence of a U shaped or inverted U shaped relationship between 
              variables in (generalized) linear models. It also implements a test of upward/downward sloping relationships at the lower and upper 
              boundary of the data range.
